I'm an Associate Member at the [Fred Hutch](https://www.fredhutch.org/) in the [Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/vaccine-and-infectious-disease.html) and the [Computational Biology Program](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/labs/phs/projects/herbold-computational-biology-program.html). I'm also an Affiliate Associate Professor in the [Department of Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu) and the [Department of Epidemiology](https://epi.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

My research program focuses on phylodynamic analysis of pathogen sequence data with an intent of making inferences that are actionable to public health. This research program spans a number of viral systems including seasonal and avian influenza, Ebola, Zika, SIV, MERS-CoV, dengue and mumps. This requires development of mathematical and statistical methods to integrate infectious disease sequence data into evolutionary and epidemiological models. I've co-developed the open-source [Nextstrain platform](https://nextstrain.org/) that aims to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data by providing a continually-updated view of publicly available data alongside powerful analytic and visualization tools. This platform is used by the World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) to aid in vaccine strain selection for seasonal influenza virus. This platform was also highlighted during the Zika epidemic in the Americas and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa as a central source for data sharing and up-to-date insights. I have published over 60 scientific journal articles and my awards include a MIRA R35 investigator award from NIGMS, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award and the NIH / HHMI / Wellcome Trust Open Science Prize.
